This is the [RDFBones](https://github.com/RDFBones) core ontology for osteological research data from anthropological investigations. All files in the repository need to be loaded into one graph. Currently, the VIVO ontology ([vivo.owl](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO/raw/develop/home/src/main/resources/rdf/tbox/filegraph/vivo.owl)) is also required in addition.

The 'robot' directory contains the script [Script-Build_RDFBones-Robot.sh](https://github.com/RDFBones/RDFBones-O/blob/robot/robot/Script-Build_RDFBones-Robot.sh) which can be used to merge the provided files into one OWL file (rdfbones.owl). The oubput can be found in the 'robot/results/' directory. To run the script, you will have to install the [ROBOT tool](https://robot.obolibrary.org/). In order to include the latest file versions from the 'master' branch, you have to rebase the 'robot' branch on 'master'.

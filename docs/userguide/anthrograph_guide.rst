Skeletal Inventories
=====================

The skeletal inventory records basic data on the skeletal individual, such as presence or absence of bones and their taphonomic alterations. Inventories can be created by clicking on the "Skeletal Inventories" link in the sidebar, entering a unique label, and selecting the according inventory type. Inventory types include adult skeletons, juvenile skeletons, and dental inventories. Creating a new inventory automatically redirects the user to the inventory's data entry page.

Once an inventory has been created, it appears in the list above the "Create new inventory" section. Clicking on the inventory name opens the inventory.

Inventory for adult skeletons
------------------------------

Inventories for adult skeletons stand in contrast to inventories for juvenile skeletons. When opening an inventory for adult skeletons, the page opens at the "General information" tab. Above the tabs are 3 important fields:

The Skeletal Inventory ID, also known as the label of the inventory, can be changed by entering a new label in the field and clicking "Change Skeletal Inventory ID".
The "DELETE EntireSkeletal Inventory" button will delete the inventory that is currently open.
The "Download CSV Table" button will generate a CSV file containing all the data that has been entered in the inventory.

The general information tab allows the user to enter a comment on the inventory. Further down is the "Create New Observer/Editing Event" section.

This allows the user to enter either an "observer" or a "data editor". In either case, a date must be selected as well. The created observer or data editor event will then appear in the list directly below.

Clicking on the event will open a new page in a new tab where information on the event can be entered.

Once the data has been entered, this page can be closed. To enter data on the status of the bones, the user must switch to the according tab. In the following image, the cranial tab has been opened:

This shows some of the items that can entered in the adult skeletal inventory: "Completeness", "Observability", and "Unsided Fragments". One of the "Completeness" fields has been selected in order to show the drop-down menu that opens. In order to save the entered information, the user must have entered data into all mandatory fields. To ensure the user need not enter an entire skeleton in one go, save buttons are bound to sizable units of skeletal regions, such as the frontal bone in the above image.

Inventory of a dentition
-------------------------

Dental inventories are created same as inventories for adult skeletons, save that the "inventory of dentition" must be selected as the inventory type.

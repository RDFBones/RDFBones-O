CIDOC CRM v6.2.1 (draft) encoded in RDFS

This is the encoding approved by CRM-SIG in the meeting 21/11/2012 
as the current version for the CIDOC CRM namespace.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but an encoding
derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v6.0 Janauary 2015 on 
http://www.cidoc-crm.org/official_release_cidoc.html

Created by FORTH-ICS  Thursday April 26, 2018


Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String" and "E94 Space Primitive" referred in
   the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdf: literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdf:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v.6.0 (January 2015) are not intended transfer errors. 
FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS
Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.

        <vitro:descriptionAnnot xml:lang="en">This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan.  
Items may be added or removed from an E78 Collection in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”).
Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.

It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.
Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an E78 Collection for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.

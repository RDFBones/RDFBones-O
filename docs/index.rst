RDFBones
========

`RDFBones`_ is an ontology for representing osteological research and resulting data in biological anthropology. It consists of a **core ontology** providing general concepts related to research in general and osteological research in particular. The core ontology is meant to be extended by additional ontologies that concretise its concepts. Researchers can write such **ontology extensions** to implement the specific methods and workflows required for their scientific work. Together, this system of ontologies forms the **RDFBones standard**.

This documentation consists of 3 parts:
	* An introduction to RDFBones, wherein the basics of how RDFBones works are explained as concisely as possible
	* A user guide to AnthroGraph, which is a software application with which data according to the RDFBones standard can be recorded. This section serves as a sort of user manual by explaining all the functions of AnthroGraph
	* A guide to the modeling principles of RDFBones and ontologies that it refers to. This section gives a more in-depth review of pivotal concepts of the RDFBones standard and general best-practices to consider when creating RDFBones extensions

Ontologies on which RDFBones is based
======================================

RDFBones is mostly composed of elements borrowed from other ontologies. In order to maintain compatibility with these, RDFBones adheres to their logics as much as possible. This introduction refers to RDFBones versions 0.2 and later.

:doc:`The Ontology of biomedical Investigations </ontologies/obi/obi_general>`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) models biological research. The OBI offers standards for the representation of samples, assays, and data analysis methods used in biomedical investigations.

The :doc:`OBI subpage </ontologies/obi/obi_general>` covers the aspects that are particularly relevant for RDFBones, those being the modelling of investigations and the modelling of unique identifiers.


:doc:`CIDOC CRM </ontologies/cidoc/cidoc_crm>`
-----------------------------------------------

CIDOC CRM is a management tool. It plays an important role in the collection management submodule of RDFBones. The :doc:`CIDOC CRM subpage </ontologies/cidoc/cidoc_crm>` gives details on CIDOC CRM and the organisation behind it.


:doc:`The Foundational Model of Anatomy </ontologies/fma>`
------------------------------------------------------------

The Foundational Model of Anatomy is a general-purpose anatomical ontology designed to be used as a base in a wide variety of medical ontologies. RDFBones takes most of its osteological and general anatomical framework from the FMA.


:doc:`Submodules of RDFBones </ontologies/submodules/submodules>`
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The subpage on :doc:`RDFBones' submodules </ontologies/submodules>` explains collection management and antomical modelling in RDFBones in more detail.

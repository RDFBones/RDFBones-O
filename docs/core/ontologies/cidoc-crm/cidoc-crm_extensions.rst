Extensions of CIDOC CRM
========================

Hiebel proposes CRMgeo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that provides a global schema for documenting spatiotemporal properties [Hiebel2017]_. It is designed to comply to the definitions and standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium in GeoSPARQL. This allows CRMgeo to integrate CIDOC CRM and its data with the spatiotemporal analyses offered by geoinformation systems.

Niccolucci proposes CRMas, an extension of CIDOC CRM using the already existing extensions of CRMdig and CRMsci, which are also designed to improve scientific documentation capabilities [Niccolucci2017]_. CRMas is intended as a documentation tool for archaeological science that can record the wide range of methods used in archaeological investigation. The focus is on the part of the investigation process that occurs while producing the results that can be used to perform an archaeological interpretation, i.e. the observation or analysis of an archaeological find. Niccolucci identifies the observation and analysis components as potential black boxes with a variety of factors that must be documented. He further defines an observation as an experiment that produces only analogic information, and an analysis as an experiment that directly produces numeric results, typically through the use of processing machinery. Both cases require adequate documentation, as successful re-use of the data by other scientists in future studies can not be guaranteed.

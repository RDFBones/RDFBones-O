CIDOC CRM v6.2.1 (draft) encoded in RDFS

This is the encoding approved by CRM-SIG in the meeting 21/11/2012 
as the current version for the CIDOC CRM namespace.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but an encoding
derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v6.0 Janauary 2015 on 
http://www.cidoc-crm.org/official_release_cidoc.html

Created by FORTH-ICS  Thursday April 26, 2018


Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String" and "E94 Space Primitive" referred in
   the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdf: literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdf:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v.6.0 (January 2015) are not intended transfer errors. 
FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS
Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="P11_had_participant">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">had participant</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an E5 Event. 
It connects the life-line of the related E39 Actor with the E53 Place and E50 Date of the event. The property implies that the Actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. The subject of a portrait can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="P46_is_composed_of">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">is composed of</rdfs:label>

	<rdfs:comment>This property allows instances of E18 Physical Thing to be analysed into component elements.

Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If  a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.

This property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.

The instances of E57 Material of which an item of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).

<rdf:Property rdf:about="P109_has_current_or_former_curator">

	<rdfs:comment>This property identifies the E39 Actor or Actors who assume or have assumed overall curatorial responsibility for an E78 Collection.

It does not allow a history of curation to be recorded. This would require use of an Event  initiating a curator being responsible for  a Collection.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E20_Biological_Object">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Biological Object</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises individual items of a material nature, which live, have lived or are natural products of or from living organisms. 
Artificial objects that incorporate biological elements, such as Victorian butterfly frames, can be documented as both instances of E20 Biological Object and E22 Man-Made Object.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived. 
Legendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises physical objects purposely created by human activity.
No assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding an object as man-made. For example, an inscribed piece of rock or a preserved butterfly are both regarded as instances of E22 Man-Made Object.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E39_Actor">
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Actor</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.
The CRM does not attempt to model the inadvertent actions of such actors. Individual people should be documented as instances of E21 Person, whereas groups should be documented as instances of either E74 Group or its subclass E40 Legal Body.

    <!-- http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E74_Group -->

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E74_Group">
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Group</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of E39 Actors that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the Group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.
A gathering of people becomes an E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modeled as membership in an E74 Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E78_Collection">
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Collection</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained ("curated" and "preserved", in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan.  
Items may be added or removed from an E78 Collection in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”).
Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E87_Curation_Activity">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Curation Activity</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the activities that result in the continuity of management and the preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Collection, following an implicit or explicit curation plan. 
It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.
Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an E78 Collection for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.

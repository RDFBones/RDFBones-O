Submodules of RDFBones
========================

Below you will find subsections elaborating on the different submodules of RDFBones.


:doc:`RDFBones Collection Management </ontologies/submodules/collection>`
==========================================================================

Collection management is a vital component of anthropological research, as specimens are often incorporated into studies long after their initial acquisition. The collection management model of RDFBones is explained on :doc:` this page </submodules/collection>`.


:doc:`RDFBones collection </ontologies/submodules/anatomical_model>`
=====================================================================

Though :doc:`the FMA </ontologies/fma>` offers an extensive anatomical model, some modifications were necessary to adapt the FMA model for use in RDFBones. These are covered by :doc:`RDFBone's anatomical model </ontologies/submodules/anatomical_model>`.

:doc:`Anatomical Regions of Interest </ontologies/submodules/regions_of_interest>`
===================================================================================

"Regions of Interest" describes a specific concept in osteology, which is explained on :doc:`this page <ontologies/submodules/regions_of_interest>`.

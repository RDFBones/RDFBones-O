RDFBones
========

`RDFBones`_ is an ontology for representing osteological research and resulting data in biological anthropology. It consists of a **core ontology** providing general concepts related to research in general and osteological research in particular. The core ontology is meant to be extended by additional ontologies that concretise its concepts. Researchers can write such **ontology extensions** to implement the specific methods and workflows required for their scientific work.
